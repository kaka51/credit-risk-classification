Overview of the Analysis
In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of the analysis is to train and evaluate the model for the loan risk.
Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The dataset includes loan_size, interest_rate, borrower_income, debt_to_income, num_of_accounts, dergatory_marks, total_debt and load_status. Base on the availabe data, we need to predict the accuracy of load_status of 0 = healthy loan and 1 = risky loan for each loan.
Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., value_counts).
The dataset includes 75036 healthy loan and 2500 risky loan.
Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
split the dataset into train and test
create and predict logistic regression model with the original data
create and predict logistic regression model with the sampled training data
Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., LogisticRegression, or any resampling method).
We used logisticregression method to predict the outcomes from dataset starting with cleaning the data and splitting it into test and train subset, then use labeled data to train the model and then validate the data to test how well the model is able to predict labels, and lastly predict label for unclassified data.
Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Machine Learning Model 1:

Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
99% of the data are correctly predicted compared to the total number of observations.
100% of the healthy loans that classified by the modal as heathy loan were actuallly heathy loan while 85% of the risky loan were actually risky
99% of all the actual healthy loan samples, were correctly classified as heathy while 91% of the risky loan were correctly classified as risky.
Machine Learning Model 2:

Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
99% of the data are correctly predicted compared to the total number of observations.
99% of the healthy loans that classified by the modal as heathy loan were actuallly heathy loan while 99% of the risky loan were actually risky
99% of all the actual healthy loan samples, were correctly classified as heathy while 99% of the risky loan were correctly classified as risky.
Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the 1's, or predict the 0's? )
If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning. The result from the logistic regression model with the resampled training data using RandomOverSampler function performs better based on the 99% accuracry, precision, and recall classification report for both healthy '0' and risky '1' loan status. Logistic regression model with orginal data is also good, but it was a bit less accurate compared to the resampled training data. Since the purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the model for the loan risk, both '1' and '0' are equally important for prediction.
